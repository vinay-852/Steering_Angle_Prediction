### ResNet-18 Based Model Architecture for Steering Angle Prediction

The architecture is based on ResNet-18, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a three-component structure: the Encoder Network, the Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) layer, and the Decoder Network consisting of two dense layers.

#### Encoder
The encoder extracts relevant features from the input image. It processes the raw input image to generate a set of feature maps that encapsulate essential visual information. ResNet-18 is chosen for its balanced depth and efficiency. ResNet-18 comprises 18 layers in total, including convolutional layers, batch normalization layers, and residual connections, which facilitate training deeper networks without encountering vanishing or exploding gradient problems. Other networks like MobileNet and EfficientNet were considered.

#### Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) Layer
SPP enables convolutional neural networks to accept input images of varying sizes without the need for resizing, which is beneficial for applications like steering angle prediction in autonomous driving where images can vary due to different resolutions and aspect ratios. By capturing features at multiple scales and preserving spatial hierarchies, SPP enhances feature extraction and allows the network to detect and interpret critical elements in the driving environment, leading to improved prediction accuracy for steering angles .

The SPP layer captures spatial information from the feature maps generated by the encoder. It pools features at multiple spatial scales, making the network invariant to object scale and enhancing its ability to handle varying input sizes. This layer reduces parameters, potentially improving efficiency on resource-limited platforms like the Jetson Nano.

#### Decoder
The decoder consists of two dense layers that take the output features from the SPP layer and regress them to predict the corresponding steering angle \( \theta \). The decoder maps high-level features from the SPP layer to precise steering angle predictions.
